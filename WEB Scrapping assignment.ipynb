    "#Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\"\"\"Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves using software or scripts to access\n",
    "web pages, retrieve the desired information, and then store it in a structured format, such as a spreadsheet or database. Web \n",
    "scraping allows users to gather large amounts of data from multiple sources quickly and efficiently, which would be otherwise \n",
    "time-consuming or impractical to collect manually.\n",
    "Financial and Economic Analysis: Web scraping is widely used in the finance industry to collect financial data, stock prices,\n",
    "economic indicators, and market sentiment. Hedge funds, investment firms, and analysts use this data to make predictions and \n",
    "inform their investment strategies.\n",
    "Academic Research and Data Mining: Researchers often employ web scraping techniques to collect relevant data for academic studies,\n",
    "sentiment analysis, or social network analysis.\n",
    "Real Estate: Real estate agencies and property listing platforms use web scraping to gather information on properties, prices, \n",

    "\"\"\"APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Some websites provide APIs that allow developers to access data in a structured \n",
    "and standardized format. APIs are a more controlled and efficient way of extracting data compared to web scraping. By making \n",
    "API requests, developers can retrieve the required data directly from the server.\n",
    "Manual Copy-Pasting: The most basic method involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a spreadsheet or a \n",
    "text document. While this approach is simple, it is suitable only for scraping small amounts of data from a few pages and can \n",
    "be time-consuming for larger-scale tasks.\n",
    "HTTP Requests and HTML Parsing: This method involves using programming languages like Python along with libraries like Requests\n",
    "and BeautifulSoup to send HTTP requests to the website's server, retrieve the HTML content of the page, and then parse the HTML\n",

    "\"\"\"Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping and parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides a convenient and \n",

    "not a web scraping framework like Scrapy, but rather a tool designed to work with existing HTML or XML data and extract relevant\n",
    "information from it.\n",
    "HTML Parsing: Beautiful Soup is primarily used to parse HTML documents. It takes raw HTML as input and converts it into a \n",
    "navigable Python object, allowing users to search, navigate, and manipulate the HTML tree structure using Pythonic syntax.\n",
    "Easy to Use: Beautiful Soup provides a simple and intuitive API, making it easy for beginners to start with web scraping. Its \n",
    "syntax is designed to be Pythonic, which means it follows the standard conventions and idioms of the Python language.\n",
    "Flexible Parser: Beautiful Soup can work with different parsers, including Python's built-in HTML parser, lxml, and html5lib. \n",
    "Each parser has its advantages and can be chosen based on the specific requirements of the scraping task.\n",
    "Tag Searching: It allows you to search for specific HTML tags or attributes, making it easy to extract relevant data based on \n",

    "Navigating the HTML Tree: Beautiful Soup allows you to navigate through the HTML tree using parent, child, and sibling relationships,\n",
