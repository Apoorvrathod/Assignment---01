    "\n",
    "Increased responsiveness: Multithreading allows concurrent execution of multiple tasks, which can improve the responsiveness of\n",
    "a program. It enables a program to continue executing other threads while waiting for I/O operations or long-running tasks, \n",
    "thus preventing the program from becoming unresponsive.\n",
    "Efficient resource utilization: Multithreading enables efficient utilization of system resources, particularly CPU cores. \n",
    "It allows tasks to be divided among multiple threads, making use of available CPU cores to perform work in parallel. This can \n",
    "result in improved performance and faster execution times for certain types of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity of synchronization: Multithreading introduces the need for synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety and \n",
    "prevent data races and other concurrency issues. Synchronizing access to shared resources can be complex and error-prone, \n",
    "requiring careful consideration and implementation of locks, semaphores, or other synchronization primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased complexity of debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be more challenging than debugging single-threaded \n",
    "programs. Issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks can be difficult to identify and reproduce. Debugging tools \n",
    "and techniques specific to multithreaded programming are often required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential for performance degradation: Multithreading does not guarantee improved performance in all scenarios. In fact, \n",
    "improperly designed or poorly synchronized multithreaded programs may suffer from performance degradation due to increased \n",
